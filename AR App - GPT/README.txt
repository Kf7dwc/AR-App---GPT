	Thank you for taking the time to look over my submission for the Prompt Engineer role you have availible.
I have put together a brief presentation on my app that you will find in my folder that I have submitted. I have also included 
copys of some of the code, in seperate files, that I am using in my application. 

	I hope you find my submissions adequate enough to move forward, I currently work full-time at a non-technical job, so I only have spare time to code,
which computers are my passion. I have been working for awhile now to gain enough skills and knowledge to be able to switch to coding full-time.
A job like this would be a life changer for my family and I. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours truly,
Richard Verner
